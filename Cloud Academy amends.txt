Study Guide & UX – Short Keyword Notes
 
1) Study Guide – how it works
 
- Inputs:
  - exam date, hours/week, learning styles, coach notes
  - profile: target cert, skill level, streak, points
 
- Content sources:
  - challenges, practice exams, flashcard decks, quizzes, games
  - all come from your real database
 
- Logic:
  - tool gathers data + progress → builds a structured weekly plan
  - spreads challenges, flashcards, quizzes, games, and a final practice exam across weeks
 
- AI role:
  - does NOT decide content
  - only formats what you provide:
    - summary, week themes, focus text, targets, accountability tips, extra resources
 
- Storage:
  - plan saved in DB (inputs + AI JSON output)
  - transformed for frontend: weeks, actions, milestones, accountability, resources
 
 
2) Irrelevant topics in SAA (data engineering / ML)
 
- Dissatisfaction:
  - SAA (Solutions Architect Associate) plan included a “data engineering / ML” week, which is off‑scope for that exam.
 
- Reasons:
  - Content pool too broad:
    - challenges/quizzes/decks are fetched as “active content”,
    - NOT filtered strictly to SAA‑tagged material.
  - AI themes not constrained:
    - AI can invent week themes and may choose “data engineering & ML” wording, even for SAA.
 
- Fix (conceptual):
  - Tag content by certification and filter selections to SAA for SAA learners.
  - Give AI the official SAA domains and instruct it to stay within them.
  - Optionally scan AI output for banned phrases (e.g. “data engineering”, “machine learning” for SAA).
 
 
3) Cloud Tycoon – no exit after journey complete
 
- Dissatisfaction:
  - After finishing a journey, the “Journey Complete!” screen only shows “Start New Journey” and no clear exit/back.
 
- Reasons:
  - Completion state:
    - header with back button is hidden when journey is complete,
    - “no journey” state (which has a back button) is not active because journey still exists,
    - completion screen only renders the “Start New Journey” button.
 
- Fix (conceptual):
  - Add a second button on the completion screen:
    - e.g. “Back to Game Hub” (`/game`) or “Exit to Learn”.
  - Or add “Finish and Exit” which clears the journey and returns to the welcome screen (which already has a back button).
 
 
4) Challenge brief – drawing/diagram not persistent
 
- Dissatisfaction:
  - Drawings in the challenge diagram area disappear after minimizing or switching tabs if not explicitly saved.
 
- Reasons:
  - Diagram state:
    - lives only in local React state inside the `DiagramCanvas`.
    - lost when the component unmounts (modal closed, page/tab reloaded).
  - Persistence:
    - only occurs when user presses “Save Now” (triggers onSave and stores diagramData).
    - no auto‑save on changes or on tab/window events.
 
- Fix (conceptual):
  - Add auto‑save on diagram changes (debounced).
  - Save when closing the workspace / switching away from drawing mode.
  - Optionally save on tab visibility change or before unload, and show a simple “All changes saved” indicator.
